In this image analysis project, I conducted a comparative study between Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and 
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction techniques for a classification task. 
The project's outcomes revealed distinct performance patterns between the two methods. 
The LBP classifier exhibited comparable precision and recall rates, resulting in an overall accuracy of 55%. 
In contrast, the HOG classifier displayed notably higher precision (77%) and recall (58%), 
leading to an overall accuracy of 58%. 
The discrepancy in performance could potentially be attributed to factors other than the feature extraction methods. 
Notably, HOG features demonstrated greater resilience to noise and lighting variations, 
possibly due to their reliance on gradient orientations rather than pixel intensities. 
This observation underscores the importance of selecting feature extraction techniques 
that align with the specific characteristics of the data and the desired outcomes of the analysis.
